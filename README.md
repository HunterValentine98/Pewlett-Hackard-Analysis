# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of our new analysis was well defined. We needed to determine the number of retiring employees based on title and position, and we needed to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We are hoping to prepare Bobby's manager for the phenomenon known as the "silver tsunami", which can be defined as a time where many current employees are reaching retirement age.


## Results
1. Senior Engineers and Senior Staff have our biggest groups of people that are about to retire. This makes sense, as they are senior employees, meaning they have more experience and time in the field.
2. Vice versa, there does not seem to be to many entry level positions retiring, such as Assistant Engineers. Most people taking this role are most likely younger, as there is not as big of a need to stress about filling these positions during the "silver tsunami".
3. With our new mentorship eligibility table, we can transfer these employees to roles in asssisting current employees for promotion to senior level positions. This will allow the senior roles to be filled as the "silver tsunami" hits.
4. The retiremnt table seems to have a flaw, in which employees who have held multiple positions at Pewlett Hackard take up a row for each position they held. Therefore, retirement numbers could be over exaggerated. Our unique titles table limits this down to only current titles, allowing for the elimination of past titles of said person. 


## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
 Our retiring tiles file allows us to see the amount of people retiring from each position. The proper shift for the "silver tsunami" would be to hypothetically fill these positions with the exact amount of people retiring. This could be through promotions of lower level positions or hiring people who have never worked for the company. We could create a new query or table (for example) that shows how many current staff title employees we have so we can fill Senior Staff positions with current employees. The same could be done for Senior engineer roles with current Engineers.
 
 2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
 I believe this question would require another analysis. We currently have a table showing all people who ar eligible to participate in mentorship. We should use this table to create another table that shows how many people are eligible for mentorship based on the title they hold. We could then apply all "Senior Staff" employees to mentor "Staff" employees for a promotion. Based on the current staff employees and "Senior Staff" mentors, we could then decide if we have enough employees to mentor the next generation. What was said above could be applied to leadership roles, engineers, etc. as well!
