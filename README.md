# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of our new analysis was well defined. We needed to determine the number of retiring employees based on title and position, and we needed to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We are hoping to prepare Bobby's manager for the phenomenon known as the "silver tsunami", which can be defined as a time where many current employees are reaching retirement age.


## Results
1. Senior Engineers and Senior Staff have our biggest groups of people that are about to retire. This makes sense, as they are senior employees, meaning they have more experience and time in the field.
2. Vice versa, there does not seem to be to many entry level positions retiring, such as Assistant Engineers. Most people taking this role are most likely younger, as there is not as big of a need to stress about filling these positions during the "silver tsunami".
